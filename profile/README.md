## 🔐 Security & Transparency Notice

Flashing custom ROMs always carries risk, especially when the project is **closed source** or lacks public accountability.

Some ROMs — including **Project Elixir** and **DerpFest** — do not provide full source availability or independent review, making it difficult for users to verify what is actually running on their devices.

Without publicly auditable code, users cannot easily confirm:
- How system components are implemented
- Whether sensitive data is handled safely
- If unintended or malicious behavior exists

This can increase exposure to:
- Privacy issues
- Data leakage
- Unauthorized access to personal information

### Our recommendation:
- ✅ Choose ROMs with publicly available source code
- ✅ Review commits and development activity
- ✅ Consider maintainer reputation and community trust

Transparency matters. Installing software you can’t inspect means placing full trust in the developer.
